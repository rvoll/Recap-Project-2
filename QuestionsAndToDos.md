# Recap Project 2: Questions and To Dos

In a previous project, you've created the layout for a Quiz App with HTML and CSS. The focus of this
project is to add interactivity with JavaScript.

## To Dos

# Styling:

- get the box labels on the form page to left-align with the boxes:

  I have now given the labels a class and am terying to fix this in css.

- get rid of "br />'s" in form.html! instead do the formatting with .css!

- added border-radius: 6px;
  to the button in form.css to make it look nicer - do the same on the other pages for uniform layout!
  (not important)

- so far, the area around the nav icon is highlighted; change this so that the icon itself is highlighted/filled/struck (not so impportant, may not even be wanted)!

## Questions

- in form.css:
  /_ How do I get the text (box labels) to left-align?_/
- in form.css:  
  /_ How do I get the form not to disappear
  behind the header when teh page is reloaded?_/

# real issues:

- couldn't you outsource the nav bar items so that there is one html file (mayybe index.html) that contains them all, and all other connected htmls (personal page, form page, etc.) get it from there and add the active state to the respective link?

## Notes

-        linebreak; das ist jetzt einfacher als mit css:
        <br />
