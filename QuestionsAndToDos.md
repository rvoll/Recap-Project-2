# Recap Project 2: Questions and To Dos

In a previous project, you've created the layout for a Quiz App with HTML and CSS. The focus of this
project is to add interactivity with JavaScript.

## To Dos

- so far, the area around the nav icon is highlighted; change this so that the icon itself is highlighted/filled/struck (not so impportant, may not even be wanted)

## Questions

- couldn't you outsource the nav bar items so that there is one html file (mayybe index.html) that contains tehm all, and all other connected htmls (personal page, form page, etc.) get it from there and add the active state to the respective link?
